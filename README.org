** tree-sitter-langs

This is a convenient language bundle for the Emacs package [[https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter][tree-sitter]]. It serves as an interim distribution mechanism, until ~tree-sitter~ is widespread enough for language-specific major modes to incorporate its functionalities.

For each supported language, this package provides:
1. Pre-compiled grammar binaries for 3 major platforms: macOS, Linux and Windows, on x86_64. In the future, ~tree-sitter-langs~ may provide tooling for major modes to do this on their own.
2. An optional ~highlights.scm~ file that provides highlighting patterns. This is mainly intended for major modes that are not aware of ~tree-sitter~. A language major mode that wants to use ~tree-sitter~ for syntax highlighting should instead provide the query patterns on its own, using the mechanisms defined by [[https://ubolonton.github.io/emacs-tree-sitter/syntax-highlighting/interface-for-modes/][tree-sitter-hl]].
